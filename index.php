					The Diatom Herbarium of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, one of the largest in the world, houses 
					over 260,000 slides, of which about 5,000 are types, including both fossil and modern diatoms collected from fresh, 
					brackish, and marine habitats. In addition to its world coverage and its inclusion of fossil diatoms, the herbarium 
					has an extensive record of materials collected as part of freshwater environmental surveys from throughout the United 
					States. These surveys were the work of the former Department of Limnology, and its successor, the Academy’s Phycology 
					Section of the Patrick Center for Environmental Research. Often extending over decades, these surveys offer a unique 
					resource for the study of long-term changes in diatom populations and ecology.
				</p>
				<p>
					The core research collection is a compilation of smaller collections founded in the nineteenth and early twentieth 
					century by amateur diatomists. Many additional collections were donated by diatomists from all over the world.  
				</p>
				<p> 
					The Diatom Herbarium contains many special collections named after the diatomist who put the collection together. 
					These collections were given to the Diatom Herbarium by the diatomist, or by their family. Several collections 
					include slides and/or materials of other diatomists, or the collections may have been part of a larger collection 
					of another individual.
